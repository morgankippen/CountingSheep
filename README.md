# Sleepy Sheepy
A series of sheep-themed minigames made in Godot/

Though unfinished, it is available to play [here on itch.io](https://morgan404.itch.io/sheepminigames)

-----

### Minigame 1: Counting Sheep
Inspired by popular mobile game Flappy Bird and the concept of counting sheep to fall asleep.
Control the sheep character by clicking, and try not to hit into any fences.

 ### Minigame 2: Sheep Dreams
Control the sheep with your mouse, collecting white clouds for points; but make sure to avoid the storm clouds, otherwise it's game over.
